This website shows my recent projects and their documentation.

Since github-pages only allows for static webpages, the project pages (as well as everything else) is generated using the `pagegen.py` python script.  

The generation sript has only been tested on Ubuntu and MacOS.

Run `pagegen.py --help` for how to use the script.

Requirements for Building the Webpages:

- [python3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [yattag](https://pypi.org/project/yattag/)
